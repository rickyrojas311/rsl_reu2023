# Anatomical Guided Reconstruction for Deuterium Metabolic Imaging
Code used for Ricky Rojas's 2023 RSL REU Project on AGR for Deuterium Metabolic Imaging. 

_subclass files include sigpy subclasses that implement new operators for anatomical reconstruction
_class bundles the operators together in an easy-to-use class
_practice files are toy problems
All other files are notebooks to generate the reconstructions, tweak their parameters, and display the results in matplotlib
