# Anatomical Guided Reconstruction for Deuterium Metabolic Imaging
Code used for Ricky Rojas's 2023 RSL REU Project on AGR for Deuterium Metabolic Imaging. 

# SET UP
_(sub)class files are independent from other repositories and only rely on themselves and imported dependencies <br />
_reconstructions rely on data simulated from the pydeutmr repository by Phil Adamson and I which can be cloned here (https://github.com/philadamson93/pydeutmr/tree/ricky) <br /> <br />

_subclass files include sigpy subclasses that implement new operators for anatomical reconstruction <br />
_class bundles the operators together in an easy-to-use class <br />
_practice files are toy problems <br />
All other files are notebooks to generate the reconstructions, tweak their parameters, and display the results in matplotlib
